1. Constructor Issues
Constructor only sets employeeName but not companyName or initial salary

2. Setter Method Problems
There is a bug: salary = salary; assigns parameter to itself instead of instance variable

Should be this.salary = salary;

Failure: When salary is negative, it prints a message but doesn't prevent the invalid assignment

Salary remains unchanged or becomes 0

There is no else clause to handle salary assignment

3. calculateBonus() Method Issues
Return type mismatch: Method is declared void but tries to return a value

It should be public double calculateBonus()

Salary is also not initialized before use

this could lead to logical errors

4. Class Design Problems
I think the class EmployeeManagement has been poorly named as it sounds like a system/utility class, but it's representing an individual employee

Should be named Employee

Static field is misused as companyName is static but not initialized anywhere

If shared by all employees, should be initialized (e.g., in static block or constructor)

Missing getter methods as there is no way to retrieve employeeName or salary values

Missing encapsulation as companyName is public (should likely be private with getter/setter)

5. Code Quality Issues
There is no input validation in constructor as name could be null or empty

There is inconsistent naming as Parameter name vs field employeeName

The number 0.1 in bonus calculation should be a named constant

6. Potential Runtime Problems
employeeName could be null if passed to constructor

Division by zero is possible if bonus calculation were percentage-based with variable rate
